SKincare Recommendation System

This project builds an intelligent skincare product recommendation system that aggregates multi-platform data, analyzes key product attributes, and generates personalized rankings using a UCB-inspired scoring model. We scraped product information from Amazon, eBay, Target, and Sephora, cleaned and standardized the data, and designed a recommendation engine that combines general weight training with user-defined preferences. Users can rank four product attributes—current price, unit price, star rating, and review counts—and the system updates attribute weights through an interactive reordering step to produce refined Top-5 recommendations. The project includes web scraping logic, data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, a hybrid UCB model, and a simple frontend demonstrating the full recommendation workflow.
